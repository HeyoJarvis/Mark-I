- **Confidence Scoring**: High/Medium/Low confidence levels with numeric scores
- **Parameter Extraction**: Automatic extraction of business parameters from user requests

### 2. **Agent Integration Framework**
- **Agent Registry**: Centralized agent management with metadata and capabilities
- **Agent Executor**: Asynchronous agent execution with response caching
- **Response Formatter**: Structured response formatting for different agent types
- **Feedback System**: User feedback collection and agent revision triggers

### 3. **Branding Orchestrator**
- **Request Processing**: End-to-end request handling from user input to branded output
- **Session Management**: Persistent session storage with Redis
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance metrics and audit logging
- **Health Monitoring**: Component health checks and status reporting

### 4. **Scalable Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Plug-and-play agent integration pattern
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking agent execution
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Security**: Task locking and isolation between agents

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Branding Request
```python
# Initialize orchestrator
config = OrchestrationConfig(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")
orchestrator = BrandingOrchestrator(config)
await orchestrator.initialize()

# Process request
response = await orchestrator.process_request(
    user_request="I need a brand name for my coffee shop",
    session_id="user_123"
)

# Get results
brand_name = response.get('brand_name')
logo_prompt = response.get('logo_prompt')
color_palette = response.get('color_palette')
```

### Intent Parsing
```python
# Parse user intent
parser = IntentParser()
parsed_intent = await parser.parse_intent("Help me design a logo")

print(f"Intent: {parsed_intent.primary_intent}")
print(f"Confidence: {parsed_intent.confidence}")
print(f"Suggested agents: {parsed_intent.suggested_agents}")
```
