2. {{change_2}}
3. {{change_3}}

Given these changes, I believe we're now in a much better position to help {{company}} {{value_proposition}}.

Would you be open to a brief call to explore if the timing is better now? I can share how {{similar_company}} overcame similar challenges and achieved {{specific_outcome}}.

Available for a quick chat {{availability}}?

Best regards,
