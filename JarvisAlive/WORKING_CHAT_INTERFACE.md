# For development (uses mock responses)
# No API key needed
```

### **Integration Options**

```bash
python semantic_chat_interface.py
```

#### **2. Web API Integration**  
```python
from semantic_chat_interface import SemanticChatInterface

chat = SemanticChatInterface()
await chat.initialize()

# Handle user messages
response = await chat.chat(user_message, session_id)
return response
```

#### **3. Custom Integration**
```python
# In your existing app
chat = SemanticChatInterface(OrchestrationMode.SEMANTIC_WITH_FALLBACK)
await chat.initialize()

@app.post("/chat")  
async def chat_endpoint(message: str, session: str):
    return await chat.chat(message, session)
```

## 🎉 **Your Chat Interface Replaces Initial Orchestration**

- ✅ **Intelligent fallbacks** for unsupported requests
